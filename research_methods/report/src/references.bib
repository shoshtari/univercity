	abstract = { Logs have been widely adopted in software system development and maintenance because of the rich runtime information they record. In recent years, the increase of software size and complexity leads to the rapid growth of the volume of logs. To handle these large volumes of logs efficiently and effectively, a line of research focuses on developing intelligent and automated log analysis techniques. However, only a few of these techniques have reached successful deployments in industry due to the lack of public log datasets and open benchmarking upon them. To fill this significant gap and facilitate more research on AI-driven log analytics, we have collected and released loghub, a large collection of system log datasets. In particular, loghub provides 19 real-world log datasets collected from a wide range of software systems, including distributed systems, supercomputers, operating systems, mobile systems, server applications, and standalone software. In this paper, we summarize the statistics of these datasets, introduce some practical usage scenarios of the loghub datasets, and present our benchmarking results on loghub to benefit the researchers and practitioners in this field. Up to the time of this paper writing, the loghub datasets have been downloaded for roughly 90,000 times in total by hundreds of organizations from both industry and academia. The loghub datasets are available at https://github.com/logpai/loghub. },

	ABSTRACT = {Contemporary security information and event management (SIEM) solutions struggle to identify critical security incidents effectively due to the overwhelming number of false alerts generated by disparate security products, which results in significant alert fatigue and hinders effective incident response. To overcome this challenge, we propose a next-generation SIEM framework that integrates security orchestration automation and response capabilities and utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy to mitigate the impact of low-quality IDS alerts. The proposed framework leverages advanced machine learning and data visualization tools—including a cost-sensitive learning method and an event segmenting algorithm—to filter and correlate alerts plus an augmented visualization tool to expedite the triage process. The proposed framework was evaluated experimentally on a dataset collected from a real-world enterprise network, and we report highly convincing results. The alert screening scheme demonstrates significant potential for real-world security operations. We believe that our findings will contributing to the development of a next-generation SIEM system that effectively addresses alert fatigue and lays the foundation for future research in this field.},
